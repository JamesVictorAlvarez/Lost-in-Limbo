<h2 id="about-the-game"> :pencil: About Our Game</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
  The game will be set in the main character’s house in an alternate reality. The main purpose of the game is for the player to escape the Backrooms. To do so, they will need to get through a total of three levels to survive. The main character will have to navigate in a specific area of the house in order to beat the level. Each level may require the player to explore, solve a puzzle, communicate with non-playable characters (NPC) or defeat the enemy character.

<h2 id="story"> :floppy_disk: Story</h2>

<p align="justify"> 
  The story follows a nameless main character who fell asleep on the bus and wakes up in Level 94 of the backrooms. The bus carrying him leaves him in front of a house and he sleepily goes inside thinking it's his. Once inside, little details make him confused, until furniture starts moving. He starts believing his family is playing a trick on them and looks for them. He instead finds someone crying on the floor, a friendly NPC who is also lost in the backroom. Together, they assess their situation, solve the first puzzle to get the first key, and find a room with 5 slides. They decide to take two random ones, sliding into the next level. 

While sliding, the main character hears a scream. Once at the end, they realize that their slide was safe, while some others lead to death. They didn’t expect to see their new friend come out of his slide, but he did. He looked weird; his limbs connected to his body in awkward ways. The NPC says he broke their arm on the way down, but he’s okay. The next level involves pushing boxes and jumping around to get the second key. While the main character does it, the suspicious NPC just watches him with bloodshot eyes and a wide grin. He eventually gets the key, and they exit the second level. 

As they walk in the third one, the main character starts suspecting the NPC and calls him out. This triggers the NPC to reveal himself as a Skinwalker and start the third level: a chase. While being chased, the main character finds the key and gets to the door, putting three keys inside. The door doesn’t open. Instead, every time the player clicks on the door to open it, the Skinwalker gets teleported back to a set position, giving time to the player to realize that the door is faulty and find the real one. Once they opened that real one, they finally escaped. They are greeted with the sight of his wife and children at the dinner table.
