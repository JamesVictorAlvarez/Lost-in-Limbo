<p align="justify"> 
  The game will be set in the main character’s house in an alternate reality. The main purpose of the game is for the player to escape the Backrooms. To do so, they will need to get through a total of three levels to survive. The main character will have to navigate in a specific area of the house in order to beat the level. Each level may require the player to explore, solve a puzzle, communicate with non-playable characters (NPC) or defeat the enemy character.

  In this project, the Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently. I implemented general search algorithms such as depth-first, breadth-first, uniform cost, and A* search algorithms which are used to solve navigation problems in the Pacman world.
